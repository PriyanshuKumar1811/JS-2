So whenever there is a button inside the form tag and when you click on it, it basically creates an action 
of form submission, and it will always reload the page. So how do we stop this, so what we have to do is, 
we have to basically capture that event. The event which basically is refreshing the page.

event.preventDefault();

You don't do the default action of submission. Whenever the button is clicked, we are telling the form element. 
Hey form element, please do not do the default action of form submission. Do not do the default action of 
reloading the page.
